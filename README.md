# fathom-algo-search-lab

`fathom-algo-search-lab` treats algorithms as a local verification problem. The OCaml implementation is intentionally narrow, but the fixtures and notes make the behavior explicit.

## Fathom Algo Search Lab Checkpoints

Treat the compact fixture as the contract and the extended examples as a scratchpad. The code should stay boring enough that a change in behavior is obvious from the test output.

## What This Is For

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Architecture Notes

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The OCaml implementation keeps the data record and functions small enough to load directly in the test file.

## Case Study

`pressure` is the first example I would inspect because it lands on the `review` path with a score of 105. The broader file also keeps `degraded` at -15 and `surge` at 235, which gives the model a useful low-to-high spread.

## Useful Pieces

- Uses fixture data to keep complexity tradeoffs changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for golden cases, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents boundary checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Tooling

Install OCaml and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.

## Quality Gate

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Project Layout

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Scope

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Expansion Ideas

- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add one more algorithms fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Local Workflow

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.
